This is tiddlypouch plugin for ~[[TiddlyWiki|tiddlywiki.com]].
This plugin uses PouchDB library to provide a store for your tiddlers. 
Tiddlers are saved to the built-in database of your browser. It is also possible to setup a remote
database and make tiddlypouch sync your local database with the remote one! This allows you very
interesting workflows like ''working offline'' and syn back to the server when you come back online.
